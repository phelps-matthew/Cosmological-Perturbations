\abstract{
In the theory of cosmological perturbations, extensive methods of simplifying the equations of motion and eliminating non-physical gauge modes are required in order to construct the perturbative solutions. One approach is to first fix the gauge freedom by imposing coordinate constraints and then solve the fluctuation equations directly in terms of the metric perturbation. In the context of conformal gravity, we implement this method by constructing a gauge condition that is invariant under conformal transformations, allowing the full set of exact solutions to be obtained within any background geometry that is conformal to flat (thus including all cosmologically relevant geometries). With this construction, we show that in a radiation era Robertson-Walker cosmology, conformal gravity fluctuations grow as $t^4$. Another approach in solving the fluctuation equations is to decompose the metric perturbation into a basis of scalars, vectors, and tensors defined according to their transformation behavior under three-dimensional rotations. With this basis automatically facilitating gauge invariance, it is asserted that the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors decouple within the fluctuation equations themselves, a la the \textit{SVT decomposition theorem}. Here we investigate the status of the decomposition theorem by solving the fluctuation equations exactly within standard cosmologies as applied to both Einstein gravity and conformal gravity, finding that in general the various SVT gauge-invariant combinations only separate at a higher-derivative level. To achieve separation at the  level of the fluctuation equations themselves one must additionally impose spatial boundary conditions, with an exact form depending on the particular background geometry. To match the underlying transformation group of GR and thus provide a manifestly covariant formalism, we introduce an alternate scalar, vector, tensor basis with components defined according to general four-dimensional coordinate transformations. In this basis, the fluctuation equations greatly simplify, and while one can again decouple them into separate  gauge-invariant  sectors  at  the  higher-derivative level, in  general  we  find  that  even  with boundary conditions we do not obtain a decomposition theorem in which the fluctuations separate at the level of the fluctuation equations themselves.
