	abstract = {In a series of ﬁve lectures I review inﬂationary cosmology. I begin with a description of the initial conditions problems of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker ({FRW}) cosmology and then explain how inﬂation, an early period of accelerated expansion, solves these problems. Next, I describe how inﬂation transforms microscopic quantum ﬂuctuations into macroscopic seeds for cosmological structure formation. I present in full detail the famous calculation for the primordial spectra of scalar and tensor ﬂuctuations. I then deﬁne the inverse problem of extracting information on the inﬂationary era from observations of cosmic microwave background ﬂuctuations. The current observational evidence for inﬂation and opportunities for future tests of inﬂation are discussed. Finally, I review the challenge of relating inﬂation to fundamental physics by giving an account of inﬂation in string theory.},

The topics include relativistic cosmological perturbation theory with the scalar-vector-tensor decomposition, the evolution of adiabatic and isocurvature initial ﬂuctuations, microwave background anisotropy, spatial and angular power spectra, the cold dark matter linear transfer function, Press-Schechter theory, and a brief introduction to numerical simulation methods.},

The contents include elementary mechanics in cosmology, Eulerian and Lagrangian fluid dynamics, hot dark matter, and relativistic cosmological perturbation theory. To typeset the notes one must first obtain the style files and figures in file figmac.uu sent separately. Place all the files in one directory, run latex three times, and run dvips or equivalent to produce a postscript file.},
