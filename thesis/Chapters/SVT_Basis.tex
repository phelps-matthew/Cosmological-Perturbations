\label{c:scalar_vector_tensor_basis}

In the field of perturbative cosmology, it is standard to first introduce a 3+1 decomposition of the metric perturbation followed by a decomposition into SO(3) scalars, vectors, and tensors (the SVT decomposition)\cite{Ellis2012}. For fluctuations around a Minkowski background the decomposition takes the form

In studying cosmological fluctuations it is very convenient to use the SVT decomposition of the fluctuations because it readily incorporates gauge  invariance  \cite{bardeen_1980}.

%
The discussion of the three dimensional SVT expansion begins by taking a flat background geometry of the form $ds^2=dt^2-\delta_{ij}dx^idx^j$ where $\delta_{ij}$ represents a generic flat 3-space metric (equating to the Kronecker delta for a Minkowski background). Upon introducing a metric fluctuation $h_{\mu\nu}$ and performing a 3+1 decomposition, the geometry may be written as

	\footnote{In application to cosmological backgrounds, we will find it convenient to decompose the fluctuation around a conformal to flat background by incorporating an explicit factor of $\Omega^2(x)$, with the perturbed geometry taking the form
	\begin{eqnarray}
	ds^2 &=& \Omega^2(x) \bigg[ (1+2\phi) dt^2 -2(\tilde{\nabla}_i B +B_i)dt dx^i - [(1-2\psi)\delta_{ij} +2\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_j E

	\end{eqnarray}
	%
	Here $\Omega(x)$ is an arbitrary function of the coordinates, where $\tilde{\nabla}_i=\partial/\partial x^i$ (with Latin index) and  $\tilde{\nabla}^i=\delta^{ij}\tilde{\nabla}_j$ (not $\Omega^{-2}\delta^{ij}\tilde{\nabla}_j$) are defined with respect to the background 3-space metric $\delta_{ij}$. SVT3 elements obey the same relations as in \eqref{APsvt3_rel}, i.e. transverse and traceless with respect to the background 3-space metric.}

\begin{eqnarray}
ds^2 &=&(-\eta_{\mu\nu}-h_{\mu\nu})dx^{\mu}dx^{\nu}
\nonumber\\

%
where $\tilde{\nabla}_i=\partial/\partial x^i$ and  $\tilde{\nabla}^i=\delta^{ij}\tilde{\nabla}_j$  (with Latin indices) are defined with respect to the background three-space metric $\delta_{ij}$. In addition, the SVT3 components within (\ref{2.1}) are required to obey
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta^{ij}\tilde{\nabla}_j B_i = 0,\quad \delta^{ij}\tilde{\nabla}_j E_i = 0, \quad E_{ij}=E_{ji},\quad \delta^{jk}\tilde{\nabla}_kE_{ij} = 0, \quad \delta^{ij}E_{ij} = 0.
\label{2.2}
\label{APsvt3_rel}
\end{eqnarray}
%
As written, (\ref{2.1}) contains ten elements, whose transformations are defined with respect to the background spatial sector as four 3-dimensional scalars ($\phi$, $B$, $\psi$, $E$), two transverse 3-dimensional vectors ($B_i$, $E_i$) each with two independent degrees of freedom, and one symmetric 3-dimensional transverse-traceless tensor ($E_{ij}$) with two degrees of freedom. A la, the scalar, vector, tensor (SVT) decomposition. 

To implement the decomposition of $h_{\mu\nu}$ to the SVT3 form in \eqref{2.1}, we utilize transverse and transverse-traceless projection operators as applied to tensor and vector components to yield a decomposition into scalars, vectors, and tensors. Both the 3+1 decomposition and projection operators have been derived in developed in detail within Appendix \ref{aa:svt_projection}.

\subsection{SVT3 in Terms of $h_{\mu\nu}$ in a Conformal Flat Background}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Following \cite{amarasinghe_2019, phelps_2019} and making use of the projection operators in Appendix \ref{aa:svt_projection}, we express the ten degrees of freedom of the SVT3 components in a conformal to flat background in terms of the original fluctuations $h_{\mu\nu}$. First we introduce the 3-dimensional Green's function obeying
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta^{ij}\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_jD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})=\delta^3(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}).
\label{AP64}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Upon setting $h_{\mu\nu}=\Omega^2(x)f_{\mu\nu}$, the line element of (\ref{AP62}) takes the form 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
ds^2&=&-[\Omega^2(x)\eta_{\alpha\beta}+h_{\alpha\beta}]dx^{\alpha}dx^{\beta}
\nonumber\\
&=&-\Omega^2(x)[\eta_{\alpha\beta}+f_{\alpha\beta}]dx^{\alpha}dx^{\beta}
\nonumber\\
&=&\Omega^2(x)\left[dt^2-\delta_{ij}dx^idx^j-f_{00}dt^2-2f_{0i}dtdx^i-f_{ij}dx^idx^j\right],
\nonumber\\
\delta^{ij}f_{ij}&=&-6\psi+2\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}^iE,
\tilde{\nabla}^jf_{ij}=-2\tilde{\nabla}_i\psi+2\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^kE+\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^kE_{i},
\nonumber\\
\tilde{\nabla}^i \tilde{\nabla}^jf_{ij}&=&-2\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\psi+2\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}E
\nonumber\\
&=&\frac{4}{3}\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}E+\frac{1}{3}\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\delta^{ij}f_{ij}
\nonumber\\
&=&4\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\psi+\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k(\delta^{ij}f_{ij}),
\nonumber\\
2\phi&=&-f_{00},\qquad
B=\int d^3yD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\tilde{\nabla}_y^if_{0i},\qquad B_i=f_{0i}-\tilde{\nabla}_iB,
\nonumber\\
\psi&=&\frac{1}{4}\int d^3yD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\tilde{\nabla}_y^k\tilde{\nabla}_y^{\ell}f_{k\ell}-\frac{1}{4}\delta^{k\ell}f_{k\ell},
\nonumber\\
\qquad
E&=&\int d^3yD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\left[\frac{3}{4}\int d^3zD^{(3)}(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{z})\tilde{\nabla}_z^k\tilde{\nabla}_z^{\ell}f_{k\ell}-\frac{1}{4}\delta^{k\ell}f_{k\ell}\right],
\nonumber\\
E_i&=&\int d^3yD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\bigg{[}\tilde{\nabla}_y^jf_{ij}
-\tilde{\nabla}^y_i\int d^3zD^{(3)}(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{z})\tilde{\nabla}_z^k\tilde{\nabla}_z^{\ell}f_{k\ell}\bigg{]},
\nonumber\\
2E_{ij}&=&f_{ij}+2\psi\delta_{ij} -2\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_j E - \tilde{\nabla}_i E_j - \tilde{\nabla}_j E_i, 
\label{AP65}
\end{eqnarray}
%
One may readily check that $B_i$, $E_i$, and $E_{ij}$ are indeed transverse by applying appropriate derivatives, thus confirming their obeying (\ref{APsvt3_rel}).

The integral form of the inversions of the SVT3 components is unique up to integration by parts, which plays a role in the analysis of asymptotic behavior, discussed in detail within Sect. \ref{ss:gauge_struct_svt3}.

\subsection{SVT3 in Terms of the Traceless $k_{\mu\nu}$ in a Conformal Flat Background}
\label{ss:svt3_in_terms_of_k_mu_nu}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We have shown in Sect. \ref{s:conformal_gravity} that in conformal to flat backgrounds, the perturbed Bach tensor $\delta W_{\mu\nu}$ may be expressed entirely in terms of the traceless $K_{\mu\nu}$. As such, it will prove useful to be able to express the SVT components in terms of the traceless part of $f_{\mu\nu}$. Defining $K_{\mu\nu}=\Omega^2k_{\mu\nu}$, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
K_{\mu\nu}=h_{\mu\nu}-(1/4)\Omega^2\eta_{\mu\nu}\Omega^{-2}\eta^{\alpha\beta}h_{\alpha\beta}=h_{\mu\nu}-(1/4)\eta_{\mu\nu}\eta^{\alpha\beta}h_{\alpha\beta},
\end{eqnarray}
whereby we factor out the conformal factor to form the traceless $k_{\mu\nu}$ as
\begin{eqnarray}
k_{\mu\nu}=f_{\mu\nu}-(1/4)\eta_{\mu\nu}[-f_{00}+\delta^{ij}f_{ij}].
\end{eqnarray}
%
Substituting $f_{\mu\nu}$ in terms of this $k_{\mu\nu}$, we obtain from \eqref{AP65} the following integral relations for the SVT components:
\begin{eqnarray}
k_{00}&=&\frac{3}{4}f_{00}+\frac{1}{4}\delta^{k\ell}f_{k\ell},\qquad k_{0i}=f_{0i},\qquad k_{ij}=f_{ij}+\frac{1}{4}\delta_{ij}f_{00}-\frac{1}{4}\delta_{ij}\delta^{k\ell}f_{k\ell},
\nonumber\\
\phi&=&-\frac{1}{2}f_{00},\qquad
B=\int d^3yD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\tilde{\nabla}_y^ik_{0i},\qquad B_i=k_{0i}-\tilde{\nabla}_iB,
\nonumber\\
\psi&=&\frac{1}{4}\int d^3yD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\tilde{\nabla}_y^k\tilde{\nabla}_y^{\ell}k_{k\ell}-\frac{3}{4}k_{00}+\frac{1}{2}f_{00},
\nonumber\\
\qquad
E&=&\int d^3yD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\left[\frac{3}{4}\int d^3zD^{(3)}(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{z})\tilde{\nabla}_z^k\tilde{\nabla}_z^{\ell}k_{k\ell}-\frac{1}{4}k_{00}\right],
\nonumber\\
E_i&=&\int d^3yD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\bigg{[}\tilde{\nabla}_y^jk_{ij}
-\tilde{\nabla}^y_i\int d^3zD^{(3)}(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{z})\tilde{\nabla}_z^k\tilde{\nabla}_z^{\ell}k_{k\ell}\bigg{]},
\nonumber\\
2E_{ij}&+&2\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_j E +\tilde{\nabla}_i E_j +\tilde{\nabla}_j E_i
=k_{ij}-\frac{1}{2}\delta_{ij}k_{00}
\nonumber\\
&&\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+\frac{1}{2}\delta_{ij}\int d^3yD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\tilde{\nabla}_y^k\tilde{\nabla}_y^{\ell}k_{k\ell}.
\label{AP66}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Here can see that all SVT3 components can be expressed in terms of $k_{\mu\nu}$ along with a single component of $f_{\mu\nu}=\Omega^{-2}(x)h_{\mu\nu}$, namely $f_{00}$.  Recalling that $\delta W_{\mu\nu}$ can only depend on $k_{\mu\nu}$, we note that the combination $\phi+\psi$ is independent of $f_{00}$ and only depends on $k_{\mu\nu}$. Hence, we expect this coupled combination to be associated with the scalar SVT component of conformal gravity. Indeed, we confirm such a relation later in Sect. \ref{ss:deltaW_conformal_flat_SVT3}.

\subsection{Gauge Structure and Asymptotic Behavior}
\label{ss:gauge_struct_svt3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As given in \eqref{2.1} and its integral form in \eqref{AP65}, we have shown the form of the SVT3 decomposition of $h_{\mu\nu}$ comprising 10 independent components of scalars, vectors, and tensors. Due to the coordinate freedom, it must hold that linear combinations of the SVT quantities form precisely six gauge invariant quantities (a reduction from ten initial degrees of freedom minus four coordinate transformations). Consequently, we seek to determine the coefficient combinations of the SVT quantities that form the gauge invariants. In general, this may be accomplished by manipulating the relations between the SVT components and the components of $h_{\mu\nu}$ in a general background. This procedure is carried out in \eqref{2.6} in a flat background and in \eqref{9.46a} within a general Roberston Walker background. Before discussing these results, it is informative to first analyze the structure of the gauge invariants within Einstein gravity in a source-free flat background. With the background $T_{\mu\nu}=0$ vanishing, the perturbed Einstein tensor $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ itself is a completely gauge invariant tensor. As a function only of the metric, inspection of the components of the Einstein tensor will thus reveal the appropriate flat space gauge invariant combinations. The Einstein fluctuation takes the form,
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta G_{00}&=&- 2 \delta^{ab} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a}\psi,
\nonumber\\
\delta G_{0i}&=&- 2 \tilde{\nabla}_{i}\dot{\psi}+ \tfrac{1}{2} \delta^{ab} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a}(B_{i} -  \dot{E}_{i}),
\nonumber\\
\delta G_{ij}&=&- 2 \delta_{ij} \ddot{\psi} -  \delta^{ab} \delta_{ij} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a}(\phi+\dot{B}  -\ddot{E})+ \delta^{ab} \delta_{ij} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a}\psi 
	\nonumber\\
&&
+ \tilde{\nabla}_{j}\tilde{\nabla}_{i}(\phi+\dot{B} -  \ddot{E})
-  \tilde{\nabla}_{j}\tilde{\nabla}_{i}\psi
+ \tfrac{1}{2} \tilde{\nabla}_{i}(\dot{B}_{j} - \ddot{E}_{j}) + \tfrac{1}{2} \tilde{\nabla}_{j}(\dot{B}_{i}  
- \ddot{E}_{i})
\nonumber\\
&&- \ddot{E}_{ij} + \delta^{ab} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a}E_{ij},
\nonumber\\
g^{\mu\nu}\delta G_{\mu\nu}&=&-\delta G_{00}+\delta^{ij}\delta G_{ij}=4 \delta^{ab} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a}\psi -6\ddot{\psi}-2 \delta^{ab} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a}(\phi+\dot{B}  -\ddot{E}),
\nonumber\\
\label{2.3}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where the dot denotes the time derivative $\partial/\partial x^0$. As mentioned, while the generic metric fluctuation $h_{\mu\nu}$ has ten components, because of the freedom to make four gauge transformations on the coordinates (i.e $h_{\mu\nu}\rightarrow h_{\mu\nu}-\partial_{\mu}\epsilon_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}\epsilon_{\mu}$), $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ can only depend on a total of six of them. Looking at the individual components of $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$, we see that these are proportional to the combinations $\psi$, $\phi+\dot{B}  -\ddot{E}$, $B_{i} -  \dot{E}_{i}$, and $E_{ij}$. 

However, with these identifications, there still remains a degree of ambiguity as to whether the combinations listed form the gauge invariants, or whether it is in fact derivative combinations that are truly gauge invariant. Here one must proceed carefully, as the gauge invariance of $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ entails that only when taken with the various derivatives that appear in (\ref{2.3}) will these combinations be gauge invariant. For example, we may only state definitively that $\delta G_{00}$ is gauge invariant (hence $\delta^{ab} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a}\psi$). The gauge invariance of $\psi$ itself cannot be assumed through the analysis on $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ alone.


To further investigate gauge invariance issues, we express each of the various SVT3 components in terms  of combinations of the original components of $h_{\mu\nu}$. Such a procedure has been derived in \cite{amarasinghe_2019} and is to be contrasted with the integral formulations in \eqref{AP65}. Specifically, in \eqref{AP65} we mentioned uniqueness up to integration by parts, whereas here such issues are avoided as we merely apply sequences of derivatives to $h_{\mu\nu}$ to form the requisite gauge invariant structure, and afterward analyze which SVT combinations are formed as a result. The gauge invariants take the following form: using the definition
%
\begin{eqnarray}
2\phi&=&-h_{00},\quad B_i+\tilde{\nabla}_iB=h_{0i},
\nonumber\\
h_{ij}&=&-2\psi\delta_{ij} +2\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_j E + \tilde{\nabla}_i E_j + \tilde{\nabla}_j E_i + 2E_{ij},
\label{2.4}
\end{eqnarray}
%
we apply derivatives to obtain the relations
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta^{ij}h_{ij}&=&-6\psi+2\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}^iE,\quad
\tilde{\nabla}^jh_{ij}=-2\tilde{\nabla}_i\psi+2\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^kE+\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^kE_{i},
\nonumber\\
\tilde{\nabla}^i \tilde{\nabla}^jh_{ij}&=&-2\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\psi+2\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}E,
\label{2.5}
\end{eqnarray}
%
which then allow us to form the gauge invariants, taking the form
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\psi&=&\frac{1}{4} \left[\tilde{\nabla}^i \tilde{\nabla}^jh_{ij}-\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k(\delta^{ij}h_{ij})\right],
\nonumber\\
\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}E&=&\frac{3}{4} \tilde{\nabla}^i \tilde{\nabla}^jh_{ij}-\frac{1}{4}\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k(\delta^{ij}h_{ij}),

\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^kB&=&\tilde{\nabla}^kh_{0k},

\nonumber\\
\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^kE_{ij}&=&\frac{1}{2}\big[\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^kh_{ij}-\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}^kh_{kj}-\tilde{\nabla}_j\tilde{\nabla}^kh_{ki}
\nonumber\\
&&+\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_j(\delta^{k\ell}h_{k\ell})\big]+\delta_{ij}\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\psi
\nonumber\\
&&+\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_j\psi,
\nonumber\\
\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^kE_{ij}&=&
\frac{1}{2} \tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}\big[\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^kh_{ij}-\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}^kh_{kj}-\tilde{\nabla}_j\tilde{\nabla}^kh_{ki}
\nonumber\\
&&+\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_j(\delta^{k\ell}h_{k\ell})\big]+\frac{1}{4}\left[\delta_{ij}\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}+\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_j \right]\times
\nonumber\\
&&\left[\tilde{\nabla}^m \tilde{\nabla}^nh_{mn}-\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k(\delta^{mn}h_{mn}) \right],
\nonumber\\
\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell} \tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k(B_i-\dot{E}_i)&=&
\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^kh_{0i}
-\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}^kh_{0k}
-\partial_0\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^jh_{ij}
\nonumber\\
&&+\partial_0\tilde{\nabla}_{i}\tilde{\nabla}^{k}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}h_{k\ell},
\nonumber\\
\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}(\phi+\dot{B}-\ddot{E})&=&
-\tfrac{1}{2}\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}h_{00}
+\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}\partial_0\tilde{\nabla}^kh_{0k}

\nonumber\\
&&+\tfrac{1}{4}\partial_0^2\tilde{\nabla}_{k}\tilde{\nabla}^{k}(\delta^{ij}h_{ij}).
\label{2.6}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Given (\ref{2.6}) one can readily check that under a gauge transformation $h_{\mu\nu}\rightarrow h_{\mu\nu}-\partial_{\mu}\epsilon_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}\epsilon_{\mu}$ the combinations  $\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\psi $, $\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^kE_{ij}$, $\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k(B_i-\dot{E}_i)$ and $ \tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}(\phi+\dot{B}-\ddot{E})$ are gauge invariant. We see here that it was in fact necessary to apply higher order derivatives than found in $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ in order to express each of the SVT3 components entirely in terms of combinations of components of the $h_{\mu\nu}$. Hence, we repeat that it is not the quantities $\psi$, $E_{ij}$, $B_i-\dot{E}_i$ and $\phi+\dot{B}-\ddot{E}$ themselves that are necessarily gauge invariant; rather, it is their derivatives that are  gauge invariant. In comparing \eqref{2.6} to (\ref{2.3}) we see that it is the quantity $\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\psi$ that appears in $\delta G_{00}$ and that it is the combination $ \tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^kE_{ij}-\delta_{ij}\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\psi-\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_j\psi$ that appears in  $\delta G_{ij}$. Thus these  combinations are automatically gauge invariant.

To touch basis with \eqref{AP65}, we could proceed to integrate the relevant equations in (\ref{2.6}) in order to check gauge invariance for $\psi$, $\phi+\dot{B}-\ddot{E}$, $B_{i}-\dot{E_i}$ and $E_{ij}$ themselves, since we can set

(Here $q^2=\delta^{ij}q_{i}q_{j}$, and in $\tilde{\nabla}_y^i$ the $y$ indicates that the derivative is taken with respect to the $y$ coordinate, and likewise for other coordinate choices.)

As eluded to below \eqref{AP65}, there remains however an issue within (\ref{2.7}) and (\ref{2.8}). Specifically, since $\psi$ and $E_{ij}$ are manifestly gauge invariant as is (they are expressed in terms of the gauge-invariant flat 3-space $\delta R_{ij}$ and $\delta^{ij}\delta R_{ij}$), in order to show the gauge invariance of $\phi+\dot{B}-\ddot{E}$ and $B_i -\dot{E}_i$ we would need to be able to integrate by parts (i.e., for $\phi+\dot{B}-\ddot{E}$  we would need to bring $\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell} \tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k$ and $\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}$ inside the double integral, while for $B_i-\dot{E}_i$ we would need to bring $\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}$ inside, and similarly to show tranverness for $B_i -\dot{E}_i$ and $E_{ij}$ we need to be able to integrate by parts.) Consequently, we are then forced to one of three scenarios. Either a) we must put constraints on how $h_{\mu\nu}$ is to behave asymptotically, or b) restrict to requiring in the $E_{ij}$ sector that only $\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^kE_{ij}$ be gauge invariant and that only $\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^kE_{ij}$ be transverse or c) in the $E_{ij}$ plus $\psi$ sector restrict to requiring that only $\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^kE_{ij}-\delta_{ij}\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\psi-\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_j\psi$ be gauge invariant and that only $\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^kE_{ij}$ be transverse.

	\footnote{
	In a similar manner, we may also integrate the remaining SVT3 components, obtaining
	%
	\begin{eqnarray}
	2\phi&=&-h_{00},\quad
	B=\int d^3yD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\tilde{\nabla}_y^ih_{0i},

	\label{2.12}
	\end{eqnarray}
	%
	As constructed, we see that $\tilde{\nabla}^iB_i=0$. However to show $\nabla^iE_i=0$, we need to be able to integrate by parts. Using (\ref{2.4}) and (\ref{2.6}) directly, we can then show that both $\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}(\phi+\dot{B}-\ddot{E})$ and $\tilde{\nabla}_k\tilde{\nabla}^k\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}^{\ell}(B_i-\dot{E}_i)$ are gauge invariant, with the gauge invariance of $\phi+\dot{B}-\ddot{E}$ and $B_i-\dot{E}_i$ themselves then following when defining $B$, $B_i$, $E$ and $E_i$ according to (\ref{2.12}). Hence, granted the freedom to integrate by parts, we can show that for fluctuations around flat spacetime all of the six $\psi$, $E_{ij}$,  $\phi+\dot{B}-\ddot{E}$ and $B_i-\dot{E}_i$ quantities that appear in $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ as given in (\ref{2.3}) are gauge invariant.
	}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To see how method a), constraining the asymptotic behavior of $h_{\mu\nu}$, may resolve the issues of integration by parts, we shall take $h_{\mu\nu}$  to be localized in space and oscillating in time. Specifically, for each mode we will set $h_{ij}=\epsilon_{ij}(q)e^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{x}-i\omega(q) t}$ with $\omega(q)$ as yet undefined (and thus not necessarily equal to $q$), and where $\epsilon_{ij}(q)$ serves as the polarization tensor. As a localized packet, we constrain the form of the polarization tensor by excluding any functional dependence of the form $\delta(q)$ or $\delta(q)/q$. Thus, referring to \eqref{2.7} and \eqref{2.8}, for spatially localized fluctuations comprising a single mode, the quantities $\psi$ and $E_{ij}$ given in (\ref{2.7}) and (\ref{2.8}) evaluate to
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\psi&=&e^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{x}-i\omega(q) t}\frac{[q^kq^{\ell}\epsilon_{k\ell}(q)-q^2\delta^{k\ell}\epsilon_{k\ell}(q)]}{4q^2},
\nonumber\\
E_{ij}&=&e^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{x}-i\omega(q) t}\bigg{[}\frac{[q^2\epsilon_{ij}(q)-q_iq^k\epsilon_{kj}(q)-q_jq^k\epsilon_{ki}(q)+q_iq_j\delta^{k\ell}\epsilon_{k\ell}(q)]}{2q^2}
\nonumber\\
&+&\frac{(\delta_{ij}q^2+q_iq_j)[q^kq^{\ell}\epsilon_{k\ell}(q)-q^2\delta^{k\ell}\epsilon_{k\ell}(q)]}{4q^4}\bigg{]}.
\label{2.10}
\end{eqnarray}
%
With application of $\tilde\nabla^j$, one may confirm the transverse relation $\tilde{\nabla}^jE_{ij}=0$. To construct a wave packet, we sum over all modes viz. $h_{ij}=\sum_qa_q\epsilon_{ij}(q)e^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{x}-i\omega(q) t}$, to then obtain
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\psi&=&\sum_qa_qe^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{x}-i\omega(q) t}\frac{[q^kq^{\ell}\epsilon_{k\ell}(q)-q^2\delta^{k\ell}\epsilon_{k\ell}(q)]}{4q^2},
\nonumber\\
E_{ij}&=&\sum_qa_qe^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{x}-i\omega(q) t}\bigg{[}\frac{[q^2\epsilon_{ij}(q)-q_iq^k\epsilon_{kj}(q)-q_jq^k\epsilon_{ki}(q)+q_iq_j\delta^{k\ell}\epsilon_{k\ell}(q)]}{2q^2}
\nonumber\\
&+&\frac{(\delta_{ij}q^2+q_iq_j)[q^kq^{\ell}\epsilon_{k\ell}(q)-q^2\delta^{k\ell}\epsilon_{k\ell}(q)]}{4q^4}\bigg{]},
\label{2.11}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where again $\tilde{\nabla}^jE_{ij}=0$. Since the set of all $e^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{x}-i\omega (q)t}$ plane waves is complete for fluctuations around flat, any mode can be expanded as a general sum $h_{ij}=\sum_qa_q\epsilon_{ij}(q)e^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{x}-i\omega(q) t}$, with it following that (\ref{2.11}) then holds for the complete plane wave basis. Hence, by constructing the $\psi$ and $E_{ij}$ in a localized plane-wave basis, we confirm the transverse relation $\tilde\nabla^j E_{ij} = 0$ without encountering issues related to integration by parts.

While we have demonstrated the role asymptotic behavior plays within tradeoff of transverse behavior vs. gauge invariance, it is also of importance to consider under conditions the SVT3 decomposition of $h_{\mu\nu}$ may be afforded in the first place. We revisit the SVT3 derivation constructed in \cite{amarasinghe_2019} with an eye towards boundary conditions and asymptotic behavior. 

Let us suppose that we are given a general vector $A_i$ and we desire to extract out its transverse and longitudinal components, to thereby construct a relation $A_i=V_i+\partial_iL$ where $\partial_iV^i=0$. Applying $\partial^i$, it follows that
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_i\partial^iL=\partial_iA^i.
\label{2.13}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Recalling the Green's identity
%
\begin{eqnarray}
A \partial_i\partial^iB-B \partial_i\partial^iA=\partial_i(A\partial^iB-B\partial^iA),
\label{1.9}
\end{eqnarray}
and introducing the Green's function
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_i\partial^i D(\mathbf x-\mathbf y) = \delta^3(\mathbf x- \mathbf y),
\end{eqnarray}
%
the general  solution to (\ref{2.13}) is of the form 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
L({\bf x})&=&\int d^3yD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\partial^y_jA^j({\bf y})\\
\nonumber\\
&&+\int dS_y^i\left[L({\bf y})\partial^y_iD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})-D^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\partial^y_iL({\bf y})\right].
\label{2.14}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Now utilizing $A_i = V_i + \partial_i L$, it follows that 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
A_i({\bf x})&=&V_i({\bf x})+\partial^x_iL=V_i({\bf x})+\partial^x_i\int d^3yD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\partial^y_jA^j({\bf y})
\nonumber\\
&+&\partial^x_i\int dS_y^i\left[L({\bf y})\partial^y_iD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})-D^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\partial^y_iL({\bf y})\right].
\label{2.15}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Upon applying $\partial_x^i$ to (\ref{2.15}), we obtain
%
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\partial_x^i\partial^x_i\int dS_y^i\left[L({\bf y})\partial^y_iD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})-D^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\partial^y_iL({\bf y})\right]=0,
\label{2.16}
\end{eqnarray}
%
to thus establish that $\partial_i\int dS^i(L\partial_iD^{(3)}-D^{(3)}\partial_iL)$ is transverse. At this point, we appear to have constructed two transverse components - both $V_i$ and 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_i\int dS^i(L\partial_iD^{(3)}-D^{(3)}\partial_iL)
\end{eqnarray}
%
itself. To allow $V_i(x)$ to serve as the unique transverse component of $A_i(x)$, we must then require that $\partial_i\int dS^i(L\partial_iD^{(3)}-D^{(3)}\partial_iL)$ vanish. Consequently, we see that we must inadvertently impose a constraint on $A_i$, namely that $A_i$ be spatially asymptotically well-behaved. Thus, the unique decomposition of $A_i$ into longitudinal and traverse components necessarily entails an assumption regarding the asymptotic behavior of $A_i$. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{SVTD}
\label{s:svtd}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

While the SVT3 formalism presented thus far has demonstrated that the gauge invariant SVT3 quantities are covariant, one may note that these quantities have been defined with respect to the three-dimensional subspace of the full four-dimensional spacetime. With the general $h_{\mu\nu}$ behaving under coordinate transformation as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
h_{\mu\nu} \to h_{\mu\nu}' = \frac{\partial x'^\alpha}{\partial x^\mu}\frac{\partial x'^\beta}{\partial x^\nu} h_{\alpha\beta},
\end{eqnarray}
%
we see that a quantity such as $h_{00} = -2\phi$ may transform into a scalar involving vector components. To see this, let us form the four vector $h_{0\mu}$, which in terms of SVT3 components takes the form
\begin{eqnarray}
h_{0\mu} = \begin{pmatrix}-2\phi\\B_1 + \tilde\nabla_1 B\\B_2 + \tilde\nabla_2 B\\B_3 + \tilde\nabla_3. B\end{pmatrix}
\end{eqnarray}
Now, with the full four-dimensional coordinate transformation mixing each of the four components of $h_{0\mu}$, we see that the transformation of $\phi$ may induce a contribution due to a vector $B_i$. 

Thus to decompose the $h_{\mu\nu}$ into a set of scalars, vectors, and tensors that remain closed under the Poincare group, we must develop a formalism that matches the underlying space-time dimensionality; namely an SVT4 formalism. We proceed to do so here in a flat spacetime, following the series of steps given within \cite{phelps_2019}. It is no additional overhead to generalize this to $D$ dimensions here, with even further generalization to arbitrary curved spacetimes found in detail within Appendix \ref{aa:svt_projection}.

We defined Greek indices to range over the full D-dimensional space and begin with the construction of a symmetric rank two tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$, taken to be transverse and traceless in the full D-dimensional space.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\footnote{The previously introduced $E_{ij}$ was only transverse and traceless in a 3-dimensional subspace.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Accounting for the dimensionality and the transverse traceless constraints, $F_{\mu\nu}$ tensor will have $D(D+1)/2-D-1=(D+1)(D-2)/2$ components. To facilitate the decomposition, we introduce a D-dimensional  vector $W_{\mu}$. In terms of this $W_{\mu}$ and $h$, and motivated by \cite{mannheim_2005}, we define the general $h_{\mu\nu}$ fluctuation around a flat D-dimensional space to be of the form
%
\begin{eqnarray}
h_{\mu\nu}=2F_{\mu\nu}+\nabla_{\nu}W_{\mu}+\nabla_{\mu}W_{\nu}+\frac{2-D}{D-1}\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}\int d^DyD^{(D)}(x-y)\nabla^{\alpha}W_{\alpha}
\nonumber\\
-\frac{g_{\mu\nu}}{D-1}(\nabla^{\alpha}W_{\alpha}-h)-\frac{\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}}{D-1}\int d^DyD^{(D)}(x-y)h,
\label{3.1}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where the flat spacetime $D^{(D)}(x-y)$ obeys 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}D^{(D)}(x-y)=\delta^{(D)}(x-y).
\label{3.2}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Parallel to the SVT3 asymptotic behavior discussed in Sec. \ref{ss:gauge_struct_svt3}, it is implied in the form of $h_{\mu\nu}$ that the D-dimensional integrals exist, specifically with $\nabla^{\alpha}W_{\alpha}$ being sufficiently well-behaved at infinity.
To make the $F_{\mu\nu}$ that is defined by (\ref{3.1}) be transverse and traceless requires D+1 conditions, D to be supplied by $W_{\mu}$ and one  to be supplied by $h$. Given the defined \eqref{3.1}, one may take the trace and confirm that $F_{\mu\nu}$ is traceless as written. To assess whether $F_{\mu\nu}$ is transverse, we apply $\nabla^{\nu}$  to (\ref{3.1}) yielding
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\nabla^{\nu}h_{\nu\mu}=\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}W_{\mu}.
\label{3.3}
\end{eqnarray}
% 
Thus \eqref{3.3} serves to define the as yet determined $D$ components of $W_\mu$ in terms of the $h_{\mu\nu}$. Questions on the asymptotic behavior of $\nabla^{\alpha}W_{\alpha}$ are thus directly linked the asymptotic behavior of $h_{\mu\nu}$. Hence, for a $W_{\mu}$ that obeys (\ref{3.3}) and is sufficiently bounded, the D-dimensional rank two tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ is transverse and traceless.

Uponj applying $\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}$ to (\ref{3.1}) we obtain
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}h_{\mu\nu}&=&2\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}F_{\mu\nu}+\nabla_{\nu}\nabla^{\alpha}h_{\alpha\mu}+\nabla_{\mu}\nabla^{\alpha}h_{\alpha\nu}+\frac{2-D}{D-1}\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}\nabla^{\alpha}W_{\alpha}
\nonumber\\
&-&\frac{g_{\mu\nu}}{D-1}(\nabla^{\alpha}\nabla^{\beta}h_{\alpha\beta}-\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}h)-\frac{\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}}{D-1}h,
\label{3.4}
\end{eqnarray}
%
and on rearranging we obtain
%
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}h_{\mu\nu}-\nabla_{\nu}\nabla^{\alpha}h_{\alpha\mu}-\nabla_{\mu}\nabla^{\alpha}h_{\alpha\nu}+\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}h
\nonumber\\
&=&2\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}F_{\mu\nu}+\frac{2-D}{D-1}\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}[\nabla^{\alpha}W_{\alpha}-h]
\nonumber\\
&&-\frac{g_{\mu\nu}}{D-1}(\nabla^{\alpha}\nabla^{\beta}h_{\alpha\beta}-\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}h).
\label{3.5}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Now in flat spacetime, we note that the perturbed curvature tensors $\delta R$ and $\delta R_{\mu\nu}$ are independelty gauge invariant. Thus, armed with the SVTD formalism, we use these to determine the gauge invariants
%
\begin{eqnarray}
2\delta R_{\mu\nu} = \nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}h_{\mu\nu}-\nabla_{\nu}\nabla^{\alpha}h_{\alpha\mu}-\nabla_{\mu}\nabla^{\alpha}h_{\alpha\nu}+\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}h
\label{dricci}
\end{eqnarray}
%
%
\begin{eqnarray}
-\delta R = \nabla^{\alpha}\nabla^{\beta}h_{\alpha\beta}-\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}h.
\label{driccis}
\end{eqnarray}
Making use of
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\nabla_{\beta}\nabla^{\beta}[\nabla^{\alpha}W_{\alpha}-h]=\nabla^{\alpha}\nabla^{\beta}h_{\alpha\beta}-\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}h,
\label{3.6}
\end{eqnarray}
%
we define
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\nabla^{\alpha}W_{\alpha}-h=\int d^DyD^{(D)}(x-y)[\nabla^{\alpha}\nabla^{\beta}h_{\alpha\beta}-\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}h],
\label{3.7}
\end{eqnarray}
%
and with this solution and reference to \eqref{dricci} and \eqref{driccis} we see that  $\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}F_{\mu\nu}$ is thus gauge invariant. However, we note again that parallel to the discussion the SVT3 tensor $E_{ij}$, to show that $\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}F_{\mu\nu}$ is transverse requires that we one can justify an integrate by parts.

For the remaining SVTD components, we make the following definitions
%
\begin{eqnarray}
2\chi&=&\frac{1}{D-1}[\nabla^{\alpha}W_{\alpha}-h],\quad 
\quad 2F=\frac{1}{D-1}\int d^DyD^{(D)}(x-y)[D\nabla^{\alpha}W_{\alpha}-h],
\nonumber\\
F_{\mu}&=&W_{\mu}-\nabla_{\mu}\int d^DyD^{(D)}(x-y)\nabla^{\alpha}W_{\alpha}.
\label{3.8}
\end{eqnarray}
%
As constructed, within (\ref{3.8}) $F_\mu$ is defined such that $\nabla^{\mu}F_{\mu}=0$. As for $\chi$, we note with (\ref{3.7}) we find that  $\chi$ is the integral of a gauge-invariant function so that $\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}\chi$ is also automatically gauge invariant. Finally, with (\ref{3.8}) we can express (\ref{3.1}) in terms of the SVTD quantities as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
h_{\mu\nu}=-2g_{\mu\nu}\chi+2\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}F
+ \nabla_{\mu}F_{\nu}+\nabla_{\nu}F_{\mu}+2F_{\mu\nu},
\label{3.9}
\end{eqnarray}
%
to thus complete the SVTD basis decomposition of $h_{\mu\nu}$. In a general D-dimensional basis $F_{\mu\nu}$ has $(D+1)(D-2)/2$ components, the transverse $F_{\mu}$ has $D-1$ components, the two scalars $\chi$ and $F$ each have one component, and together they comprise the $D(D+1)/2$ components of a general $h_{\mu\nu}$. If we  elect to take $D=3$, (i.e. a decomposition of $h_{ij}$) we can then recognize (\ref{3.9}) as the spatial piece of SVT3 given in (\ref{2.1}), providing a check on our results.

Counting the degrees of freedom of the fluctuation $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ around flat D-dimensional we arrive at a total of $D(D+1)/2-D=D(D-1)/2$ independent gauge-invariant combinations. For the SVTD components, $F_{\mu\nu}$ has $(D+1)(D-2)/2$ components and $\chi$ has one. That is, the combination of $\chi$ and $F_{\mu\nu}$ precisely forms a total of $D(D-1)/2$. Moreoever with the derivatives of both them being gauge invariant, we deduce that $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ can only depend on $F_{\mu\nu}$ and $\chi$. Applying appropriate derivatives to the quantities given (\ref{3.8}) and (\ref{3.9}), we indeed form the following gauge invariant relations
%
\begin{eqnarray}
2\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}\chi&=&\frac{1}{D-1}\left[\nabla^{\alpha}\nabla^{\beta}h_{\alpha\beta}-\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}h\right],
\nonumber\\
2\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}\nabla_{\beta}\nabla^{\beta}F_{\mu\nu}&=&\nabla_{\beta}\nabla^{\beta}\left[\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}h_{\mu\nu}-\nabla_{\nu}\nabla^{\alpha}h_{\alpha\mu}-\nabla_{\mu}\nabla^{\alpha}h_{\alpha\nu}+\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}h\right]
\nonumber\\
&+&\frac{1}{D-1}\left[(D-2)\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}+g_{\mu\nu}\nabla_{\gamma}\nabla^{\gamma}\right][\nabla^{\alpha}\nabla^{\beta}h_{\alpha\beta}-\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}h],
\nonumber\\
\delta R_{\mu\nu}&=&\frac{1}{2}[2\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}F_{\mu\nu}+2(2-D)\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}\chi-2g_{\mu\nu}\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}\chi],
\nonumber\\
 \delta R&=&2(1-D)\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}\chi,
\nonumber\\
\delta G_{\mu\nu}&=&\delta R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}g^{\alpha\beta}\delta R_{\alpha\beta}=\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}F_{\mu\nu}
\nonumber\\
&&+(D-2)(g_{\mu\nu}\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}-\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu})\chi,
\nonumber\\
g^{\mu\nu}\delta G_{\mu\nu}&=&(D-2)(D-1)\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}\chi.
\label{3.10}
\end{eqnarray}
%
As written, we confirm that $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ indeed depends upon only $F_{\mu\nu}$ and $\chi$, with one readily being able to check that $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ obeys conservation $\nabla^{\nu}\delta G_{\mu\nu}=0$. Close inspection of the components of $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ reveals that only infer that from $g^{\mu\nu}\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ that $\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}\chi$ is alone gauge invariant. However, by applying $\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}$ to the $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ equation we can then additionally deduce that $\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}\nabla_{\beta}\nabla^{\beta}F_{\mu\nu}$ is gauge invariant. Importantly, we note that $F_{\mu\nu}$ nor $\nabla_\alpha\nabla^\alpha F_{\mu\nu}$ may be determined to gauge invariant without consideration issues related to its asymptotic behavior.  We will continue a discussion of the role of gauge invariance and boundedness in the following section. In addition, further detail of the SVTD construction, formalism, and gauge invariance is discussed within Appendex \ref{aa:svt_projection}. 


In $D=4$ we note that $F_{\mu\nu}$ has five components and $\chi$ has one. Since in a fluctuation around a flat four spacetime $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ can only contain six independent gauge-invariant combinations, it can only depend on $F_{\mu\nu}$ and $\chi$. Thus using a manifestly covariant formalism we replace the six gauge-invariant combinations $\psi$, $E_{ij}$,  $\phi+\dot{B}-\ddot{E}$ and $B_i-\dot{E}_i$ used in SVT3 by the six gauge-invariant combinations $F_{\mu\nu}$ and $\chi$ used in SVT4. This is an altogether more compact set of gauge-invariant combinations, with $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ as given in (\ref{3.10}) being altogether simpler than its form given in (\ref{2.3}). And being simpler to write down, it is also simpler to solve. However, before looking at solutions to the SVT4 fluctuation equations it is instructive to relate the SVT4 and SVT3 bases and determine which SVT4 components correspond to which SVT3 components.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Gauge Structure and Asymptotic Behavior ($D=4$)}
\label{S1e}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
Now even though classifying the scalar, vector, tensor expansion of the fluctuations according to their behavior under three-dimensional rotations is not manifestly covariant, it is in fact covariant as it leads to fluctuation equations that are gauge invariant, something we will explicitly demonstrate below in some specific cases. Nonetheless, it would be of value to classify the scalar, vector, tensor expansion according to a behavior that is manifestly covariant, i.e. according to an expansion that is classified according to four-dimensional general coordinate scalars, vectors and tensors. We introduced such an SVT4 expansion in \cite{Amarasinghe2018} and will develop it in detail in the body of the text below. And in fact we will find that when written in the SVT4 basis the fluctuation equations are simpler than when written according to SVT3. However, for the moment we note only that for fluctuations around a four-dimensional flat Minkowski background the SVT4 expansion takes the form 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
h_{\mu\nu}=-2\eta_{\mu\nu}\chi+2\partial_{\mu}\partial_{\nu}F
+ \partial_{\mu}F_{\nu}+\partial_{\nu}F_{\mu}+2F_{\mu\nu},
\label{1.32a}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_{\mu} F^{\mu}= 0, \quad F_{\mu\nu}=F_{\nu\mu},\quad \partial^{\nu}F_{\mu\nu} = 0, \quad \eta^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu} = 0.
\label{1.33a}
\end{eqnarray}
%
As written, (\ref{1.32a}) contains ten elements, whose transformations are defined with respect to the background as two four-dimensional scalars ($\chi$, $F$) each with one degree of freedom, one transverse four-dimensional vector  ($F_{\mu}$) with three independent degrees of freedom, and one symmetric four-dimensional transverse-traceless tensor ($F_{\mu\nu}$) with five degrees of freedom. Since the gauge-invariant equations have to  contain a total of six gauge-invariant degrees of freedom, they must contain the five-component $F_{\mu\nu}$ and one combination of the five other components that appear in (\ref{1.33a}) (without $F_{\mu\nu}$ we cannot get to six). As we will see, for fluctuations around a flat background the gauge-invariant combinations will be $F_{\mu\nu}$ and $\chi$. For fluctuations around a curved background the gauge-invariant combinations must again include the five-component $F_{\mu\nu}$, but in general the sixth gauge-invariant combination will be a linear combination of the other five components that appear in (\ref{1.33a}) (see (\ref{6.54}) below for a specific example).


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Relating SVT3 to SVT4}
\label{s:relating_svt3_to_svt4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



As constructed, for fluctuations around a flat four-dimensional background the SVT4 $F_{\mu\nu}$ has five independent components. When decomposed in an SVT3 basis it must contain a two-component transverse-traceless three-space rank two tensor, a two-component transverse three-space vector and a one-component three-space scalar. Moreover, assuming we can integrate by parts, all of these components must be gauge invariant. Thus the SVT3 rank two tensor associated with $F_{\mu\nu}$ must be $E_{ij}$ and the SVT3 vector must be  $B_i-\dot{E}_i$. However, this does not uniquely specify the three-space structure of the scalar component of $F_{\mu\nu}$ or of that of $\chi$, as gauge invariance alone does not provide sufficient information to enable us to determine what particular linear combinations of  $\psi$ and  $\phi+\dot{B}-\ddot{E}$ we should associate with each of them. Moreover, comparing the SVT3 and SVT4 expansions of $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ as given in (\ref{2.3}) and (\ref{3.10}) respectively also does not enable us to uniquely specify the needed scalar combinations. We thus require another gauge-invariant gravitational fluctuation tensor, one in which the various combinations appear in a different way. We thus need to construct the fluctuation equations associated with varying a pure metric gravitational action other than the Einstein-Hilbert one, since any such fluctuation equations would still be gauge invariant. Moreover, it would be very helpful if we could find a fluctuation equation that only involved $F_{\mu\nu}$ and not $\chi$ or $F$ or $F_{\mu}$. Such a fluctuation equation is provided by the conformal gravity theory, since its underlying conformal symmetry requires that the gravitational fluctuation tensor,  labelled $\delta W_{\mu\nu}$, be traceless, to thus only depend on five rather than six gauge-invariant quantities, to thus necessarily not possess one of the SVT3 scalars.


Conformal gravity has been advanced \cite{mannheim_kazanas_1989,mannheim_kazanas_1994,mannheim_2006,mannheim_2012,mannheim_2017} as a possible candidate alternative to standard Einstein gravity, and while we will study some of its implications for cosmology below, for the moment our interest is only in the fact that it provides us with a convenient gauge-invariant quantity $\delta W_{\mu\nu}$. As such, conformal gravity is a pure metric theory of gravity that possesses all of the general coordinate invariance and equivalence principle structure of standard gravity while augmenting it with an additional symmetry, local conformal invariance, in which  the action is left invariant under local conformal transformations on the metric of the form $g_{\mu\nu}(x)\rightarrow e^{2\alpha(x)}g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ with arbitrary local phase $\alpha(x)$. Under such a symmetry a gravitational action that is to be a polynomial function of the Riemann tensor is uniquely prescribed, and with use of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem is given by (see e.g. \cite{mannheim_2006}) 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
I_{\rm W}&=&-\alpha_g\int d^4x\, (-g)^{1/2}C_{\lambda\mu\nu\kappa}
C^{\lambda\mu\nu\kappa}
\nonumber\\
&\equiv& -2\alpha_g\int d^4x\, (-g)^{1/2}\left[R_{\mu\kappa}R^{\mu\kappa}-\frac{1}{3} (R^{\alpha}_{\phantom{\alpha}\alpha})^2\right].
\label{4.1}
\end{eqnarray}
% 
Here $\alpha_g$ is a dimensionless  gravitational coupling constant, and
%
\begin{eqnarray}
C_{\lambda\mu\nu\kappa}&=& R_{\lambda\mu\nu\kappa}
-\frac{1}{2}\left(g_{\lambda\nu}R_{\mu\kappa}-
g_{\lambda\kappa}R_{\mu\nu}-
g_{\mu\nu}R_{\lambda\kappa}+
g_{\mu\kappa}R_{\lambda\nu}\right)
\nonumber\\
&&+\frac{1}{6}R^{\alpha}_{\phantom{\alpha}\alpha}\left(
g_{\lambda\nu}g_{\mu\kappa}-
g_{\lambda\kappa}g_{\mu\nu}\right)
\label{4.2}
\end{eqnarray}
% 
is the conformal Weyl tensor. The conformal Weyl tensor has two features that are not possessed by the Einstein tensor, namely that it that vanishes in geometries that are conformal to flat (this precisely being the case for  the Robertson-Walker and de Sitter geometries that are of relevance to cosmology, with the background $T_{\mu\nu}$ then being zero),  and that for any metric $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ it transforms as  $C^{\lambda}_{\phantom{\lambda}\mu\nu\kappa} \rightarrow  C^{\lambda}_{\phantom{\lambda}\mu\nu\kappa}$ under $g_{\mu\nu}(x)\rightarrow e^{2\alpha(x)}g_{\mu\nu}(x)$, with all derivatives of $\alpha(x)$ dropping out. With all of these derivatives dropping out $I_{\rm W}$ is locally conformal invariant.

With the Weyl action $I_{\rm W}$ given in  (\ref{4.1}) being a fourth-order derivative function of the metric, functional variation with respect to the metric $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ generates fourth-order derivative gravitational equations of motion of the form \cite{mannheim_2006} 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
-\frac{2}{(-g)^{1/2}}\frac{\delta I_{\rm W}}{\delta g_{\mu\nu}}&=&4\alpha_g W^{\mu\nu}=4\alpha_g\left[2\nabla_{\kappa}\nabla_{\lambda}C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}-
R_{\kappa\lambda}C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}\right]
\nonumber\\
&=&4\alpha_g\left[W^{\mu
	\nu}_{(2)}-\frac{1}{3}W^{\mu\nu}_{(1)}\right]=T^{\mu\nu},
\label{4.3}
\end{eqnarray}
% 
where the functions $W^{\mu \nu}_{(1)}$ and $W^{\mu \nu}_{(2)}$ (respectively associated with the $(R^{\alpha}_{\phantom{\alpha}\alpha})^2$ and $R_{\mu\kappa}R^{\mu\kappa}$ terms in (\ref{4.1})) are given by
%                                                                               
\begin{eqnarray}
W^{\mu \nu}_{(1)}&=&
2g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_{\beta}\nabla^{\beta}R^{\alpha}_{\phantom{\alpha}\alpha}                                             
-2\nabla^{\nu}\nabla^{\mu}R^{\alpha}_{\phantom{\alpha}\alpha}                          
-2 R^{\alpha}_{\phantom{\alpha}\alpha}R^{\mu\nu}                              
+\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}(R^{\alpha}_{\phantom{\alpha}\alpha})^2,
\nonumber\\
W^{\mu \nu}_{(2)}&=&
\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_{\beta}\nabla^{\beta}R^{\alpha}_{\phantom{\alpha}\alpha}
+\nabla_{\beta}\nabla^{\beta}R^{\mu\nu}                    
-\nabla_{\beta}\nabla^{\nu}R^{\mu\beta}                       
-\nabla_{\beta}\nabla^{\mu}R^{\nu \beta}                          
- 2R^{\mu\beta}R^{\nu}_{\phantom{\nu}\beta}
\nonumber\\
&&+\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}R_{\alpha\beta}R^{\alpha\beta},
\label{4.4}
\end{eqnarray}                                 
%
and where $T^{\mu\nu}$ is the conformal invariant, and thus traceless, energy-momentum tensor associated with a conformal matter source.  Since $W^{\mu\nu}=W^{\mu
	\nu}_{(2)}-(1/3)W^{\mu\nu}_{(1)}$, known as the Bach tensor \cite{bach_1921},  is obtained from an action that is both general coordinate invariant and conformal invariant, in consequence, and without needing to impose any equation of motion or stationarity condition, $W^{\mu\nu}$ is automatically covariantly conserved and traceless and obeys $\nabla_{\nu}W^{\mu\nu}=0$, $g_{\mu\nu}W^{\mu\nu}=0$ on every variational path used for the functional variation of $I_{\rm W}$. Even though conformal gravity is a fourth-order derivative theory, we should note that as a quantum theory  it does not possess any of the negative norm ghost states that such higher-derivative theories are thought to have, to thus be unitary  \cite{bender_mannheim_2008a}. 

For fluctuations around a four-dimensional flat spacetime the gravitational $\delta W_{\mu\nu}$  takes the form \cite{mannheim_2006}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta W_{\mu\nu}&=&\frac{1}{2}(\eta^{\rho}_{\phantom{\rho} \mu} \partial^{\alpha}\partial_{\alpha}-\partial^{\rho}\partial_{\mu})
(\eta^{\sigma}_{\phantom{\sigma} \nu} \partial^{\beta}\partial_{\beta}-
\partial^{\sigma}\partial_{\nu})K_{\rho \sigma}
\nonumber\\
&&- \frac{1}{6}(\eta_{\mu \nu} \partial^{\gamma}\partial_{\gamma}-
\partial_{\mu}\partial_{\nu})(\eta^{\rho \sigma} \partial^{\delta}\partial_{\delta}-
\partial^{\rho}\partial^{\sigma})K_{\rho\sigma},
\label{4.5}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $K_{\mu\nu}=h_{\mu\nu}-(1/4)g_{\mu\nu}h$. Evaluating (\ref{4.5}) in the SVT3 basis given in (\ref{2.1}) gives \cite{amarasinghe_2019}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta W_{00}  &=& -\frac{2}{3} \delta^{mn}\delta^{\ell k}\tilde{\nabla}_m\tilde{\nabla}_n\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}_k (\phi + \psi +\dot{B}-\ddot{E}),
\nonumber\\	
\delta W_{0i} &=&  -\frac{2}{3} \delta^{mn}\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_m\tilde{\nabla}_n\partial_0(\phi +\psi +\dot{B}-\ddot{E})
+\frac{1}{2}\bigg[\delta^{mn}\delta^{\ell k}\tilde{\nabla}_m\tilde{\nabla}_n\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}_k(B_i - \dot{E}_i)
\nonumber\\
&& -  \delta^{\ell k}\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}_k \partial_0^2(B_i - \dot{E}_i)\bigg],
\nonumber\\	
\delta W_{ij}  &=& \frac{1}{3}\bigg{[} \delta_{ij}\delta^{\ell k}\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}_k  \partial_0^2(\phi+ \psi+\dot{B}-\ddot{E}) + \delta^{\ell k}\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}_k \tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_j (\phi + \psi +\dot{B}-\ddot{E}) 
\nonumber\\
&&- \delta_{ij} \delta^{mn}\delta^{\ell k}\tilde{\nabla}_m\tilde{\nabla}_n\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}_k(\phi + \psi +\dot{B}-\ddot{E}) -3\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_j \partial_0^2(\phi + \psi +\dot{B}-\ddot{E})\bigg{] }
\nonumber\\
&&+\frac{1}{2}\bigg[ \delta^{\ell k}\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}_k \tilde{\nabla}_i   \partial_0(B_j - \dot{E}_j)+ \delta^{\ell k}\tilde{\nabla}_{\ell}\tilde{\nabla}_k \tilde{\nabla}_j \partial_0(B_i - \dot{E}_i) - \tilde{\nabla}_i\partial_0^3(B_j - \dot{E}_j)
\nonumber\\
&&-\tilde{\nabla}_j\partial_0^3(B_i - \dot{E}_i)\bigg] +\left[\delta^{mn}\tilde{\nabla}_m\tilde{\nabla}_n-\partial_0^2\right]^2E_{ij},
\label{4.6}
\end{eqnarray}
%
with $\delta W_{\mu\nu}$ being gauge invariant on its own since for fluctuations around flat spacetime the background $T_{\mu\nu}$ and thus the fluctuation $\delta T_{\mu\nu}$ are both zero. Similarly,  evaluating (\ref{4.5}) in the SVT4 basis given in (\ref{3.9}) gives 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta W_{\mu\nu}=\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}\nabla_{\beta}\nabla^{\beta}F_{\mu\nu},
\label{4.7}
\end{eqnarray}
%
an expression that we note is structurally  simpler than its Einstein $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ counterpart given  in (\ref{3.10}). 


Because of its tracelessness, in both SVT3 and SVT4 $\delta W_{\mu\nu}$ only contains five gauge-invariant combinations. And from its SVT3 structure we can now unambiguously identify $\phi + \psi +\dot{B}-\ddot{E}$ as the three-dimensional scalar piece of $F_{\mu\nu}$. In addition, from (\ref{3.10}) we can identify $\chi$ according to $3\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla^{\alpha}\chi=-\delta^{ij}\tilde{\nabla}_i\tilde{\nabla}_j(\phi  +\psi +\dot{B}-\ddot{E})+3\delta^{ij}\tilde{\nabla}_{i}\tilde{\nabla}_{j}\psi-3\ddot{\psi}$, where we recall that for fluctuations around flat $\psi$ is gauge invariant on its own. Thus from the three-dimensional perspective, for fluctuations around flat spacetime $F_{\mu\nu}$ contains $E_{ij}$, $B_i-\dot{E}_i$ and $\phi + \psi +\dot{B}-\ddot{E}$.

\section{Decomposition Theorem and Boundary Conditions}
\label{s:decomposition_theorem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

One of the key features of this present study is in exploring the role that these very same boundary conditions play in establishing the so-called decomposition theorem. Specifically, in attempts to solve cosmological  evolution fluctuation equations that have been presented in the literature appeal is commonly made to the decomposition theorem in which it is assumed that the fluctuation equations are solved independently by the separate scalar, vector and tensor sectors, so that these sectors then evolve independently. Thus for the schematic example in which the fluctuation equations  take the generic flat space form

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{SVT3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{eqnarray}
B_i+\partial_iB=C_i+\partial_iC,
\label{1.3}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where the $B$ and $B_i$ are given by (\ref{1.1}), and where the $C$ and $C_i$ are functions given by the evolution equations with $C_i$ obeying  $\partial_iC^i=0$, the decomposition theorem requires that one set
%
\begin{eqnarray}
B_i= C_i,\quad \partial_iB=\partial_iC.
\label{1.4}
\end{eqnarray}
%
However, (\ref{1.4}) does not follow from (\ref{1.3}), since on applying $\partial^i$ and $\epsilon^{ijk}\partial_j$  to (\ref{1.3}) we obtain 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\partial^i\partial_i(B-C)=0,\quad \epsilon^{ijk}\partial_j(B_k-C_k)=0,
\label{1.5}
\end{eqnarray}
%
and from this we can only conclude that $B$ and $C$ can differ by any function $B-C=D$ that obeys $\partial^i\partial_iD=0$, while $B_k$ and $C_k$ can differ by any function $B_k-C_k=D_k$ that obeys $\epsilon^{ijk}\partial_jD_k=0$, i.e. by any $D_k$ that can be written as the gradient of a scalar. Thus in (\ref{1.5}) we have separated the various scalar and vector components that are present in (\ref{1.3}), to thus obtain a decomposition for the components. However, we cannot proceed from (\ref{1.5}) to (\ref{1.4}) without providing some further information, and as we show below, in order to do so in this particular case we will only need to impose spatially asymptotic boundary conditions of the type that we referred to above.


We would like to state again that in obtaining (\ref{1.5}) we have not obtained (\ref{1.4}) itself, viz. the conditions that would be required by the decomposition theorem, but have instead obtained a derivative version of it. As we will see below, in the various cosmological models that we shall study it will be characteristic that while the scalar, vector and tensor combinations can indeed be separated, they can only be separated at a higher-derivative level. And not only that, in some cases they only separate at a quite high derivative level. The objective of this paper is to first seek the relevant higher-derivative level at which the general scalar, vector and tensor combinations do indeed separate in some relevant cosmological models, and to then seek conditions such as asymptotic boundary conditions under which the scalar, vector and tensor combinations might then separate at the level of the equations of motion themselves. In not all of the cases that we study will this prove to be the case. The analyses of all of the various cosmological models of interest involve many steps, with the most straightforward for the reader being the SVT3 analysis of fluctuations around a de Sitter background that we provide in Sec. \ref{S7}. 


However, before getting into the complexity of actual cosmological models, and so as to give the reader a sense of what is needed in order to derive the decomposition theorem, in this introduction we shall provide a few generic examples that do not involve the need to go to a particularly high derivative level. Thus for (\ref{1.5}) itself for instance we now show that in order to be able to proceed from (\ref{1.5}) to (\ref{1.4}) we need to impose asymptotic boundary conditions. Specifically, since three-dimensional plane waves form a complete basis for the operator $\partial_i\partial^i$, we can write a general solution for $B-C=D$ in the form
%
\begin{eqnarray}
D=\sum _{\bf k}a_{\bf k}e^{i\textbf{k}\cdot \textbf{x}},
\label{1.6}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where the $a_{\bf k}$ are constrained to obey 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf k}^2a_{\bf k}=0.
\label{1.7}
\end{eqnarray}
%
However, in and of itself (\ref{1.7}) does not lead to $a_{\bf k}=0$ (and thus to $D=0$) as this is not the only allowed solution to (\ref{1.7}). Rather, since $k^2\delta(k)=0$, $k^2\delta(k)/k=0$ we can set
%
\begin{eqnarray}
a_{\bf k}&=&\alpha_k\delta(k_x)\delta(k_y)\delta(k_z)
\nonumber\\
&&+\beta_k\left[\frac{\delta (k_x)\delta (k_y)\delta (k_z)}{k_x}+\frac{\delta (k_x)\delta (k_y)\delta (k_z)}{k_y}+\frac{\delta (k_x)\delta (k_y)\delta (k_z)}{k_z}\right],
\label{1.8}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$ are constants. Inserting the $\alpha_k$ term  into (\ref{1.6}) would remove the ${\bf x}$ dependence from $D$ and provide a constant $D$ that would then not vanish at spatial infinity. Inserting the $\beta_k$ term  into (\ref{1.6}) would provide a $D$ that grows linearly in ${\bf x}$, to thus also not vanish at spatial infinity. Thus a spatially convergent  form for $D$ that would, for instance  be provided by taking  $a_{\bf k}$ to be a convergent $\exp(-{\bf k}^2a^2)$ Gaussian in momentum space would be excluded, with  $\partial_i\partial^iD=0$ having no localized solutions at all. If we can exclude non-zero $D$, we can set $B=C$, and thus via (\ref{1.3})  can set $B_i=C_i$.  A spatially asymptotic boundary condition is thus needed in order to recover a decomposition theorem. Consequently, we can correlate the establishing of the decomposition theorem with the very existence of the SVT3 basis in the first place as both require asymptotic boundary conditions.


Further insight into the role of boundary conditions can be provided by studying the behavior of $\partial_i\partial^iD=0$ in coordinate space. To this end  we recall the identity
%
\begin{eqnarray}
A \partial_i\partial^iB-B \partial_i\partial^iA=\partial_i(A\partial^iB-B\partial^iA).
\label{1.9}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Taking the generic $A$, like $D$, to be a function that obeys $\partial_i\partial^iA=0$ and taking $B$ to be the propagator $D^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})$ that obeys 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_i\partial^iD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})=\delta^3(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}),
\label{1.10}
\end{eqnarray}
%
enables us to write $A$ as an asymptotic surface term of the form 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
A({\bf x}) =\int dS_y^i\left[A({\bf y})\partial^y_iD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})-D^{(3)}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\partial^y_iA({\bf y})\right],
\label{1.11}
\end{eqnarray}
%
as integrated over a closed surface $S$. The vanishing of the asymptotic surface term then makes $A$ vanish identically. Thus the two non-trivial solutions to $\partial_i\partial^iA=0$, viz. $A$  is a constant or of the form ${\bf n}\cdot {\bf x}$ where ${\bf n}$ is a reference vector (the coordinate analogs of  (\ref{1.8})), are then excluded by an asymptotic boundary condition. Requiring that the asymptotic surface term in (\ref{1.11}) vanish then forces the only solution to $\partial_i\partial^iA=0$ to be $A=0$.

In cosmology where it is convenient to use  polar coordinates, one has to adapt (\ref{1.11}). When written  in polar coordinates with still flat metric $\gamma_{ij}$ and metric determinant $\gamma$, (\ref{1.11}) is replaced by 

%
\begin{eqnarray}
A(\textbf{x})=\int dS\left[A(\mathbf{y})\frac{\partial D^{(3)}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}{\partial  n} -D^{(3)}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\frac{\partial A(\mathbf{y})}{\partial n}\right],
\label{1.12a}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $\partial/\partial n$ is the out-directed normal derivative on the surface S, and the propagator obeys
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\nabla_i\nabla^iD^{(3)}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\gamma^{-1/2}\delta^3(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}).
\label{1.13a}
\end{eqnarray}
%
For $D^{(3)}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=-1/4\pi|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|$, (\ref{1.12a}) takes the form
%
\begin{eqnarray}
A(\textbf{x})=\frac{1}{4\pi} \int dS\left[\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|}\frac{\partial A(\mathbf{y})}{\partial n}-
A(\mathbf{y})\frac{\partial}{\partial  n}\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}|}\right].
\label{1.14a}
\end{eqnarray}
%
The asymptotic surface term will thus vanish if $A(\mathbf{y})$ behaves as $1/r^{n}$ where $n$ is positive.

\emph{from end of svt3 gauge structure}\\
Moreover, not only would  $A_i({\bf x})$ need to be asymptotically bounded so that we could uniquely decompose it into transverse and longitudinal components, as we noted for the SVT3 example given in \hyperref[c:decomposition_theorem]{Ch. 4} this is also a necessary condition for the decomposition theorem to be valid. To be specific, we note that if we take the theory to be just fluctuations around a flat background with no matter energy-momentum tensor, we can separate the various gauge-invariant combinations that appear in (\ref{2.3}) by taking derivatives of $\Delta G_{\mu\nu}=\delta G_{\mu\nu}+8\pi G \delta T_{\mu\nu}$ ($=\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ if $\delta T_{\mu\nu}=0$), to obtain
%
\begin{eqnarray}
0&=&\delta^{ab} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a}\psi,
\nonumber\\
0&=&\delta^{ab} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a} \delta^{cd} \tilde{\nabla}_{c}\tilde{\nabla}_{d}(\phi+\dot{B}  -\ddot{E}),
\nonumber\\
0&=&\delta^{ab} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a} \delta^{cd} \tilde{\nabla}_{c}\tilde{\nabla}_{d}(B_i-\dot{E}_i),
\nonumber\\
0&=&\delta^{ab} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a} \delta^{cd} \tilde{\nabla}_{c}\tilde{\nabla}_{d}(-\ddot{E}_{ij}+\delta^{ef} \tilde{\nabla}_{e}\tilde{\nabla}_{f}E_{ij}),
\label{2.19}
\end{eqnarray}
%
and note that just as in (\ref{2.6}), we need to go to fourth-order derivatives. With the decomposition theorem requiring
%
\begin{eqnarray}
0&=&- 2 \delta^{ab} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a}\psi,
\nonumber\\
0&=&- 2 \tilde{\nabla}_{i}\dot{\psi},
\nonumber\\
0&=&\tfrac{1}{2} \delta^{ab} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a}(B_{i} -  \dot{E}_{i}),
\nonumber\\
0&=&-2 \delta_{ij} \ddot{\psi} -  \delta^{ab} \delta_{ij} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a}(\phi+\dot{B}  -\ddot{E})+ \delta^{ab} \delta_{ij} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a}\psi 
\nonumber\\
&& +\tilde{\nabla}_{j}\tilde{\nabla}_{i}(\phi+\dot{B} -  \ddot{E}) - \tilde{\nabla}_{j}\tilde{\nabla}_{i}\psi,
\nonumber\\
0&=&\tfrac{1}{2} \tilde{\nabla}_{i}(\dot{B}_{j} - \ddot{E}_{j}) + \tfrac{1}{2} \tilde{\nabla}_{j}(\dot{B}_{i} 
- \ddot{E}_{i}),
\nonumber\\
0&=&- \ddot{E}_{ij} + \delta^{ab} \tilde{\nabla}_{b}\tilde{\nabla}_{a}E_{ij}
\label{2.20}
\end{eqnarray}
%
in this case, we see that if for any quantity $D$ that obeys  $\delta^{ab} \tilde{\nabla}_{a}\tilde{\nabla}_{b}D=0$ (or $\delta^{ab} \tilde{\nabla}_{a}\tilde{\nabla}_{b}\delta^{cd} \tilde{\nabla}_{c}\tilde{\nabla}_{d}D=0$) we impose spatial boundary conditions on $D$ so that $D$ (or $\delta^{ab} \tilde{\nabla}_{a}\tilde{\nabla}_{b}D$) vanishes,  the decomposition theorem will then follow for the $\delta G_{\mu\nu}$ associated with fluctuations around a flat Minkowski background. In this paper we will explore the degree to which this will also be the case for SVT3 fluctuations around some cosmologically interesting backgrounds where the fluctuation equations are more complicated than in the flat background case.

As we will see immediately in \hyperref[s:svt4]{SVT4}, we will also need an asymptotic condition in order to establish the very existence of an SVT4 decomposition for the individual components of the fluctuations. However, this is not in general sufficient to provide for a decomposition theorem for the fluctuation equation itself in the SVT4 case. So we turn now to analyze the SVT4 case in detail. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{SVT4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To see whether this basis can also lead to a decomposition theorem we consider a four-dimensional analog of (\ref{1.3}): 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
F_{\mu}+\partial_{\mu}F=C_{\mu}+\partial_{\mu}C,
\label{1.34a}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where the $F$ and $F_{\mu}$ are given by (\ref{1.32a}), and where the $C$ and $C_{\mu}$ are functions given by the evolution equations with $C_{\mu}$ obeying  $\partial_{\mu}C^{\mu}=0$. For the decomposition theorem to hold one has to be able to set
%
\begin{eqnarray}
F_{\mu}= C_{\mu},\quad \partial_{\mu}F=\partial_{\mu}C.
\label{1.35a}
\end{eqnarray}
%
However, (\ref{1.35a}) does not follow from (\ref{1.34a}), since on applying $\partial_{\mu}$  and $\epsilon_{\mu\nu\sigma\tau}n^{\nu}\partial^{\sigma}$ ($n^{\nu}$ is a reference vector) we obtain
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_{\mu}\partial^{\mu}(F-C)=0,\quad \epsilon_{\mu\nu\sigma\tau}n^{\nu}\partial^{\sigma}(F^{\tau}-C^{\tau})=0.
\label{1.36a}
\end{eqnarray}
%
While we thus have a decomposition of components, this time we do not get a decomposition theorem in the form given in (\ref{1.35a}) since $F-C$ need not be zero as it could  be equal to an arbitrary function $D$ that is harmonic and thus unconstrained. Specifically, since the set of four-dimensional plane waves provides a complete basis for the $\partial_{\mu}\partial^{\mu}$ operator, in general we can set  
%
\begin{eqnarray}
D=\sum _{\bf k}a_{\bf k}e^{i\textbf{k}\cdot \textbf{x}-ikt},
\label{1.37a}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $k=|{\bf k}|$. However, unlike the $a_{\bf k}$ in (\ref{1.6}) which obey $k_ik^ia_{\bf k}=0$, this time there is no constraint on the $a_{\bf k}$ at all, as the $a_{\bf k}$ obey $k_{\mu}k^{\mu}a_{\bf k}=0$ where $k_{\mu}k^{\mu}={\bf k}^2-k^2$ is identically equal to zero because of the Minkowski signature of the spacetime. Moreover, without violating $\partial_{\mu}\partial^{\mu}D=0$ we can set $a_{\bf k}=\exp(-a^2{\bf k}\cdot{\bf k})$, with the real part of $D$ thus being localized in space according to
%
\begin{eqnarray}
{\rm Re}[D]={\rm Re}\left[\int \frac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3}e^{-a^2k^2+i\textbf{k}\cdot \textbf{x}-ikt}\right]=
\frac{1}{16\pi^{3/2}a^3}\left[\frac{r+t}{r}e^{-(r+t)^2/4a^2}+\frac{r-t}{r}e^{-(r-t)^2/4a^2}\right],
\label{1.38a}
\end{eqnarray}
%
and thus not being constrained by any spatially asymptotic boundary condition at all (as $r\rightarrow \infty$
${\rm Re}[D]$ falls off as $\exp(-r^2)$, both for fixed $t$ and for points on the light cone where $r=\pm t$), while even being well-behaved at $r=0$. Thus because of the Minkowski signature there in general is no decomposition theorem. And whether there might be one in any given situation has to be explored on a case by case basis, and we will do this below in the body of the text for some characteristic cosmological models. In fact for SVT4 fluctuations around a de Sitter background for instance we will actually find that we do not in general get a decomposition theorem, though we will find that one can still get one not via boundary conditions at all but via initial conditions instead. However, the appropriate initial conditions have to be chosen extremely judiciously, and there would appear to be no rationale for making such a choice other than a desire to recover the decomposition theorem.

The status of the decomposition theorem changes completely  if we bring in an external source $\delta \bar{T}_{\mu\nu}$ as above, with (\ref{1.34a}) being replaced by 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
F_{\mu}-C_{\mu}+\partial_{\mu}F-\partial_{\mu}C=\bar{C}_{\mu}+\partial_{\mu}\bar{C}.
\label{1.39a}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Then, since now it is $\delta \bar{T}_{\mu\nu}$ that is causing the perturbation in the first place $F-C$ must be proportional to $\bar{C}$, so there now is no harmonic function ambiguity. Thus in the scalar sector we have
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_{\mu}\partial^{\mu}(F-C-\bar{C})=0, 
\label{1.40a}
\end{eqnarray}
%
with solution $F-C-\bar{C}=0$. Consequently,  the decomposition theorem in the form 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
F_{\mu}-C_{\mu}= \bar{C}_{\mu},\quad \partial_{\mu}(F-C)=\partial_{\mu}\bar{C}
\label{1.41a}
\end{eqnarray}
% 
then follows, doing so in fact without any need to impose any boundary or initial condition at all.

When the background is not flat we will need to generalize the SVT3 (\ref{1.1}) and SVT4 (\ref{1.32a}). One way  is to simply covariantize them with the use of covariant derivatives instead of ordinary derivatives and the use of a curved space metric instead of the flat space one, as discussed below. However, for cosmology the interesting geometries are de Sitter and Robertson-Walker, and they just happen to be conformal to flat, i.e. for them one can find coordinate systems in which the background metric is written as $ds^2=\Omega^2({\bf x},t)[dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2]$ where $\Omega ({\bf x},t)$ is an appropriate conformal factor. Thus for such geometries we can replace (\ref{1.1}) and (\ref{1.32a}) by 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
ds^2 &=&\Omega^2({\bf x},t)\left[(1+2\phi) dt^2 -2(\partial_i B +B_i)dt dx^i - [(1-2\psi)\delta_{ij} +2\partial_i\partial_j E + \partial_i E_j + \partial_j E_i + 2E_{ij}]dx^i dx^j\right],
\label{1.42a}
\end{eqnarray}
%
%
\begin{eqnarray}
h_{\mu\nu}=\Omega^2({\bf x},t)\left[-2\eta_{\mu\nu}\chi+2\partial_{\mu}\partial_{\nu}F
+ \partial_{\mu}F_{\nu}+\partial_{\nu}F_{\mu}+2F_{\mu\nu}\right].
\label{1.43a}
\end{eqnarray}
%
We shall have occasion to use these fluctuation metrics in the study of specific cosmological models that we provide in this paper.
