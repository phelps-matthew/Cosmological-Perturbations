  	\item[(1.1)]
	
	Derive the Maxwell Relations for the enthalpy $H$, the Gibbs free energy $G$, and one of the potentials that also depend on either the 
	particle number or the chemical potential (how many are there?).
	\\
	\\
	For the enthalpy $H$, 
	\[
		H = U + pV
	\]
	\ba
		dH &= dU+pdV+Vdp
		\\
		& = TdS+Vdp
	\ea
	\[
		\plr{\pdiff[H]{S}}_p = T,\quad \plr{\pdiff[H]{p}}_S = V
	\]
	\[
		\plr{\pdiff[V]{S}}_p = \pdifff{H}{S,p} = \pdifff{H}{p,S} = \plr{\pdiff[T]{p}}_S
	\]	
	\[
		\plr{\pdiff[V]{S}}_p = \plr{\pdiff[T]{p}}_S.
	\]
	For the Gibbs free energy,
	\[
		G = U-TS+pV
	\]
	\ba
		dG &= dU-SdT-TdS+pdV+Vdp\\
		& = Vdp-SdT
	\ea
	\[
		\plr{\pdiff[G]{p}}_T = V,\quad \plr{\pdiff[G]{T}}_p=-S
	\]
	\[
		\plr{\pdiff[V]{T}}_S = \pdifff{G}{T,p} = \pdifff{G}{p,T} = -\plr{\pdiff[S]{p}}_T
	\]
	\[
		\plr{\pdiff[V]{T}}_S = -\plr{\pdiff[S]{p}}_T
	\]
	\\
	We may also derive the Maxwell Relations for the Gibbs free energy that includes the chemical potential and particle number (the 
	internal energy, enthalpy, Helmholtz free energy, and Grand potential may also include $\mu dN$). 
	\[
		G = U-TS+pV
	\]
	\[
		dG = Vdp-SdT+\mu dN
	\]
	\[
		\plr{\pdiff[G]{p}}_{T,N} = V,\quad \plr{\pdiff[G]{T}}_{p,N}=-S,\quad \plr{\pdiff[G]{N}}_{T,p} = \mu
	\]
	\[
		\plr{\pdiff[S]{p}}_{T,N} = -\pdifff{G}{p,T} = -\pdifff{G}{T,p} = -\plr{\pdiff[V]{T}}_{p,N}
	\]
	\[
		\plr{\pdiff[S]{N}}_{T,p} = -\pdifff{G}{N,T} = -\pdifff{G}{T,N} = -\plr{\pdiff[\mu]{T}}_{p,N}
	\]
	\[
		\plr{\pdiff[V]{N}}_{T,p} = \pdifff{G}{N,p} = \pdifff{G}{p,N} = \plr{\pdiff[\mu]{p}}_{T,N}
	\]
	Thus our Maxwell Relations are	
	\[
		\plr{\pdiff[S]{p}}_{T,N} = -\plr{\pdiff[V]{T}}_{p,N},\quad \plr{\pdiff[S]{N}}_{T,p} = -\plr{\pdiff[\mu]{T}}_{p,N},
		\quad \plr{\pdiff[V]{N}}_{T,p} = \plr{\pdiff[\mu]{p}}_{T,N}
	\]
	\\

	\item[(1.2)]
	
	Consider a sample gas in a cylinder of fixed volume and temperate. The cylinder is divided into two chambers with a movable piston
	in between. Assuming thermodynamic equilibrium at all times and no external forces, which thermodynamic potential is minimized 	
	when the piston is standing still? 
	\\
	\\
	Let's look at the Helmholtz free energy for this system
	\ba
		dF &= dU-SdT-Tds 
		\\
		& = dQ-pdV-SdT-TdS
	\ea
	At fixed $V$, and $T$, the Helmholtz free energy is then
	\[
		dF = dQ-TdS.
	\]
	From the second law we know $dQ\le TdS$, thus we may conclude that
	\[
		dF \le 0.
	\]
	As such, the Helmholtz free energy may only decrease at fixed $V$, $T$. At equilibrium (when the piston stops moving), this energy 
	will be at a minimum.
